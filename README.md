# Password-Manager
Password Manager made using Python

Steps to run the program -
1. Before running the program, navigate to '_manager.py_', open the source code and uncomment out the '__createKey()__' method, run the program and comment it out again. This will create a '_key.key_' file, it is  
   required for encryption of user data.

2. Then Navigate to line 37, change the variable '__masterPwd__' to whatever you prefer, by default its value is set to 'asd', it is basically a master password. The Program will ask for this password to view user 
   data.
 
3. Then run '_GUI.py_'.
